# Roommates

An Icelandic soccer team is going to Portugal this summer to participate in IberCup. In the hotel, there will be 3 players in each room. This project was created to help with room assignments. Each player needs to choose 3 other players they would like to stay with. They are guaranteed to be matched with at least one of their selected options. After all players have made their selections, there is an option to generate room assignments that uses the selections from all players.
